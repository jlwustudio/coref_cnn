# Convolutional Neural Network for Coreference Resolution 

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for replicating results from
- [A Deep Learning Framework for Coreference Resolution Based on Convolutional Neural Networkn](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7889505/)
- In Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE 11th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC 2017)
- This code is the major part of model which is CNN to learn coreferenet of mention pair.

## Requirements
  * Python 3.6
  * TensorFlow 1.7.0

## Basic Usage
To train with default parameters on the tiny corpus. Unzip the data.zip on the root directory of this code and run:
```bash
python train_nn.py
```
